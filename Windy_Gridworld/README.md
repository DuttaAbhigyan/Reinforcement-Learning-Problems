1.) Windy Gridwold - This is the program to solve a modified Windy Gridworld problem with both vertical and
horizontal winds. Also along with step penalty, there will be 2 types of terminal states,
desired and an un-desired terminal state. On reaching a desired terminal state the agent will
be rewarded, and will be penalised on reaching an un-desired terminal state.

2.) Windy Gridwold (Version1) - Alongwith bug fixes, now cotains an easily configurable Stochastic Environment.
    The approaches used to solve the problems are MC+GLIE, TD(n)+GLIE, SARSA+GLIE and Q-Learning+Glie.
