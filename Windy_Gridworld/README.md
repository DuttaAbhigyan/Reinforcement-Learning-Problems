This is the program to solve a modified Windy Gridworld problem with both vertical and
horizontal winds. Also along with step penalty, there will be 2 types of terminal states,
desired and an un-desired terminal state. On reaching a desired terminal state the agent will
be rewarded, and will be penalised on reaching an un-desired terminal state.
